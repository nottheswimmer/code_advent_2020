# Code Advent 2020

My personal solutions to some problems in the 2020 Code Advent

## Day 1

  <summary>Day 1 - Spoiler warning</summary>

  The problem is basically the classic "two sum" except the output wants multiplication.
  My solution has a time and space complexity of O(n).

  For part two, it's "three sum." I included a call to the two sum solution inside a loop
  so it's O(n^2) time complexity yet still O(n) space complexity.
